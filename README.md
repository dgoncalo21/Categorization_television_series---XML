# Categorization_television_series-XML
Processing and categorization of information about television series extracted from an on-line source using XML technologies.

In this project for the course "Systems integration" a set of applications were created using Java to process and categorize
information about television series extracted from an on-line source. The project includes the following parts:

-> Part I – Selector: Reads an XML document holding information about a set of tv series, including detailed information about each series (e.g., cast, seasons, episodes),validates, processes the available data, and writes a shorter XML document (based on user preferences).

-> Part II – Processor: Converts the XML document, produced in Part I, to another XML document (which essentially reorganizes the information and adds some statistics).

-> Part III – HTMLViewer: Converts the XML document, produced in Part II, to HTML using XSLT.
